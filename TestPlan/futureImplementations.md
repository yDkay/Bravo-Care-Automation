# Some improvements and future implementations.

- 1. Automate all steps sequentially within a single test case.

  - Regarding this first step of the tasks, I don't think that implementing all those steps in a single test case is the best approach for the structure of the Automation Project.
  - We Could structure this single test case in multiple ones. Having Logins in a specific structure and testing other functionalities with a loging token/cookies already authorized, making tests more readable and more structured.
  - Separate Tests per functionality or specific pages.

- 2. The range of the test.

  - Since this is a small automation project, we could not cover all the parts available in our produc, all the webpages, funcionalities, apis and more.
  - For future improvements, implement extra validations, like API testing, performance testing, security testing and many more other types of tests to garantee the quality of the product.

- 3. Variability in the source code.

  - There was a noticible ammount of code where there was no id's reserved for the QA team, making automation a process so much harder then it should be, we need to make sure to add all the nescessary id's for the consistency of tests.

- 4. Implement an automated run for every day execution and generate/send reports to owners.

  - The implementation of a daily run + the ability of sending reports to owners so they know the quality of their product and to help on company/executive decisions.
