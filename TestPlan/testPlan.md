# We will simplify the processes for this project.

<details>
  <summary>Objectives</summary>

#### Define what the testing team aims to achieve. The objectives should also cover various aspects of the software: functionality, performance, usability, security, and compatibility. Usually functionality is the most important factor, but it does not mean that we should ignore other aspects.

#### It describes the aim of the test plan, whatever the good process and procedure they are going to follow to give quality software to customers. The overall objective of the test is to find as many defects as possible and to make software bug-free. The test objective must be broken into components and sub-components. In every component following activities should be performed.

- Automate all steps sequentially within a single test case.
- Implement the Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern.
- Make great use of resources and have great reusability

</details>
<br/>

<details>
  <summary>Scope</summary>

#### Scope is the extent and boundaries of the testing activities that will be performed. Scope is developed from the objectives, and in several cases teams can even exclude the areas that will not be covered to optimize resource allocation

#### It consists of information that needs to be tested concerning an application.

- Implement web test automation for a clothing store.

<details>
  <summary>Approach</summary>

#### Test approach is a high-level overview of how the testing will be conducted, including the types of tests that will be executed and the testing methodology that will be followed. This section also covers the testing techniques, tools, and success metrics.

#### The approach of testing different software is different. It deals with the flow of applications for future reference. It has two aspects:

- E2E Tests will be executed.
- Testing Methodologies following the Best Practices Documentation for cypress.io.
- Tools: cypress.io, mochawesome.
- Success metrics: Have a successfull run with no erros nor flakiness, generate a report and a video of each new run.

</details>
<br/>

<details>
  <summary>Roles and Responsibilities</summary>

#### This section is where we assign tasks to the right person with the right expertise. We can always go one step further and describe the communication channels and protocols that will be used to facilitate collaboration and communication among the testing members.

#### All the responsibilities and role of every member of a particular testing team has to be recorded.

- Me (Caio Consoli) will be responsable for the development and maintainability of this project regarding QA Automation.

</details>
<br/>

<details>
  <summary>Schedule</summary>

#### The project timeline may depend on whether the team chose manual or automation testing. Manual testing may work for small-scale, simple testing projects, but for large-scale projects with highly repetitive test cases, teams must adopt automation testing to speed up testing, increase test coverage, reduce human errors, and ensure test reliability.

#### Under this, it will record the start and end date of every testing-related activity. For Example, writing the test case date and ending the test case date.

- The project was done on the 2 and 3 of March 2024.
- The deadline for this project is on Monday (3/4) @ noon (12 pm).
